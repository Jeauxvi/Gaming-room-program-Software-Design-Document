# Software-Design-Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room wanted their online based game "Draw it ot Lose" to run on mutilple platforms useing Java as a programming language. They needed the application to have sinleton patterns to insure only one game was running at a time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My best work from this document was the UML diagram and explaining it in detail.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram was extremly helpful when developing the code. It helped make all aspects of the development process makes sense.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation section. I knew very little about some of the operating stsyems when writting this section.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I added a signleton patteren per the user's needs because with out implementing the user's needs, ther software will never adhear to the vision of the user.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Before this class, I didnt understand UML diagrams very much, nor did i really use them. Now UML diagrams will play a major roll in my process to designing applications
